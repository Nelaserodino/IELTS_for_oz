# IELTS_for_OZ
This is my very first project that I created as part of the final project of the Web Developer course, by Coder House.
It was my personal landing page for my English classes when I was working as a teacher. The webpage includes information about myself, the courses I gave, some information about the english test and about the Visa that students needed in order to travel to Australia.
IELTS is the name of an international english test, by Cambridge University. OZ is the short form for Australia.

## Technologies
The project was made using HTML, Bootstrap and SASS.

## Website
